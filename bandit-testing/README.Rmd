In this model, I am trying different algorithms to optimize the reward for the dataset in the Ads_CTR_Optimisation.csv file.

The data in the CSV and inspiration for the various solutions come from the [Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science] (https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning) course on Udemy.

In this dataset, we are shown if users would click on a given ad variation if they were shown the ad. 

For example, the data for the first three rows looks like this:

```
Ad 1,Ad 2,Ad 3,Ad 4,Ad 5,Ad 6,Ad 7,Ad 8,Ad 9,Ad 10
1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
```

The first user is shown an ad, and they will click on it if ad 1, 5, or 9 is shown. The second user will only click on ad 9. And the third user will not click on any ad, regardless of whih one is shown to them.

My objective is to:
- determine which ad performs the best (explore)
- maximize the reward that we earn (exploit)
