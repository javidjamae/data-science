## Monday, August 7, 2023

- Moved planning into Trello

## Monday, August 8, 2023

- Wrapped up my dive into building a neural network from scratch. Built and ran a MNIST classifier and got it to ~90% accuracy using a single hidden layer and a single output layer of 10 nodes each.
- Might come back and try different architectures, possibly using something like TensorFlow as a second revisit of the problem.
- Should also explore a few different problem spaces
