# Reinforcement Learning

The [Reinforcement Learning course](https://cdso.utexas.edu/msai#course-70) seems to directly follow the contents of chapters 1 - 13 of the course textbook [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/RLbook2018.pdf). 

To prepare for this course, I'll read the book and work through these chapters.
