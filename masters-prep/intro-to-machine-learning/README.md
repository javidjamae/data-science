# Intro to Machine Learning

This folder covers my research and preparation for the [Machine Learning](https://cdso.utexas.edu/msai) course as part of the Masters in AI program at UT Austin. 

Based on the [syllabus](./syllabus.md), I think that this course will cover a few types of ML learning and problems:

### Supervised Learning
- **Classification:** This includes methods for categorizing inputs into different classes, and the syllabus specifically mentions pattern recognition, classification, logistic regression, and neural networks.
- **Regression:** Linear regression is specifically mentioned in the syllabus, indicating the course covers problems where the goal is to predict a continuous output.

### Unsupervised Learning
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are often used for dimensionality reduction.
- **Clustering:** The mention of K-means suggests that clustering problems are covered.
- **Feature Extraction:** This can be considered part of unsupervised learning and is mentioned in the "What You Will Learn" section.

### Semi-Supervised Learning
- While not explicitly mentioned, topics such as overfitting, cross-validation, and VC Dimension may touch on concepts related to semi-supervised learning, where both labeled and unlabeled data are used.

### Other Concepts and Methods
- **Mistake Bounded Learning:** This is a specific learning framework that focuses on bounding the mistakes made by a learning algorithm.
- **Boosting:** An ensemble method that can be applied to both classification and regression tasks.
- **Bayesian Methods:** Bayesian inference is mentioned, reflecting an approach to statistical modeling and machine learning that incorporates prior knowledge and uncertainty.
- **Generative Models:** Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are mentioned, representing a category of models that learn to generate data similar to some known input data.
