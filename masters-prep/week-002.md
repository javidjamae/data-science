Rewatched the YouTube video on [Building a neural network from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU)
* I'm starting to work through it on a Jupyter notebook
  [here](neural-net-from-scratch/mnist-classification-from-scratch.ipynb)
* This [blog
  post](https://www.samsonzhang.com/2020/11/24/understanding-the-math-behind-neural-networks-by-building-one-from-scratch-no-tf-keras-just-numpy) has more details on the math behind it.
