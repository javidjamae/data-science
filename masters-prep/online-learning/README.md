# Online Learning

This folder contains my preparation work for the [Online Learning and Optimization](https://cdso.utexas.edu/msai#course-78) course. 

It appears that the course may focus on materials that come from the professors lectures [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXsmhnDvpjORzPelSDs0LSDrfJcqyLlZc) and [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r6jXNd1DD9o8v4q4XqxShRXWYdhtLMjEXWDzuv0T6LU/edit). 

To prepare for the course, I'll go through both of these lecture series.
