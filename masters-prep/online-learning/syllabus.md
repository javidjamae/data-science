# Online Learning and Optimization
This class has two major themes: algorithms for convex optimization and algorithms for online learning. The first part of the course will focus on algorithms for large scale convex optimization. A particular focus of this development will be for problems in Machine Learning, and this will be emphasized in the lectures, as well as in the problem sets. The second half of the course will then turn to applications of these ideas to online learning.
