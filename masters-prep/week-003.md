Continued going through the MNIST classification problem where I build a neural net from scratch. Continuing to work out of the Jupyter noteboox in the neural-net-from-scratch subdirectory.
* Refreshing myself on how the chain rule in calculus works
* Working through the derivative of the loss and softmax functions (using the chain rule)
