Goals
- [x] Finish watching 3blue1brown video series on [linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plzhqobowtqdpd3mizzm2xvfitgf8he_ab)

Watched first 7 videos in the 3blue1brown video series on [linear
algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plzhqobowtqdpd3mizzm2xvfitgf8he_ab)
* This part of the series was very imformative and eye opening, yet
  fairly easily comprehensible.

Finished watching 3blue1brown video series on [linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plzhqobowtqdpd3mizzm2xvfitgf8he_ab)
* I was honestly very lost during many parts of this portion of the series, yet I had a lot of foundational takeaways that I can refer back to. I think what might make sense is to do an ongoing deep dive into actually applying and practicing Linear Algebra by going through a course, and referring back to this series as I touch different parts of the area of study. I will probably start going through the Khan Academy Linear Algebra course over the next few months.

Watched a YouTube vide on [Building a neural network from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU)
* This was really inspirational because he shows how you can really just use basic linear algebra, basic Python libraries, and a good intuitive understanding of forward and backward propogation to build and train a neural network.
* I'm going to watch this again and and work through the problem myself in detail
