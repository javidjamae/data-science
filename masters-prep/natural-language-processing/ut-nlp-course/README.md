# Natural Language Processing

This folder covers my research and preparation for the [Natural Language Processing](https://cdso.utexas.edu/msai) course as part of the Masters in AI program at UT Austin.

## Mathematical Background
* Linear algebra
* Calculus
* Probability theory
* **Optimization techniques**

## Programming Skills
* Python
* PyTorch (**Prioritize PyTorch as projects are implemented using this**)
* Debugging and Optimization in Deep Learning
* **Memory and runtime efficiency techniques**

## NLP Basics
* [Linguistic fundamentals](./linguistic-fundamentals.md): Syntax, lexical and distributional semantics
* Compositional semantics
* Machine learning fundamentals, linear classification, sentiment analysis
* Neural classification and word embeddings (including **different types of embeddings like GloVe**)
* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), language modeling, and pre-training basics
* **Deep Learning Architectures: LSTM, CNN**
* Tagging with sequence models: Hidden Markov Models and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)
* Syntactic parsing: Constituency and dependency parsing, models, and inference
* Revisiting language modeling
* Question answering and semantics
* Machine translation
* BERT and modern pre-training
* Applications: Summarization, dialogue, etc.
* **Experimentation Techniques: Layers, Embedding sizes, Optimizers, Nonlinearities, Dropout layers, Initialization techniques**

## Ethics and Bias
* Understanding ethical principles in AI and NLP
* Recognizing and mitigating biases in data and models
* Responsible handling of sensitive information and privacy concerns
* Evaluating the societal impact of NLP applications
* Transparency and explainability in model decisions

## Project
Work with real dataset to solve a problem. Ideas for projects include:
1. Sentiment analysis on social media to detect mental health trends
2. Machine translation system for underrepresented languages
3. Automated summarization of academic papers
4. Question answering system for customer support
5. Bias detection and mitigation tool for NLP models
6. **Experiment with different architectures and techniques for better performance**
