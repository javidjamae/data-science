    "## Statistical Frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "We can ask probability questions about many different things.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the probability that:\n",
    "* You roll a 4 on a fair six-sided die - $P(X=4)$\n",
    "* A given die is a fair die - $P(\\text{fair})$\n",
    "* It will rain tomorrow - $P(\\text{rain})$\n",
    "* A router drops a data packet - $P( \\text{drops packet} )$\n",
    "* A product performs better than another - $P( A > B )$\n",
    "* The universe expands forever - $P( \\text{universe expands} )$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several frameworks under which we can define probabilities:\n",
    "* Classical\n",
    "* Frequentist\n",
    "* Bayesian\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classical\n",
    "Under this framework, outcomes that are equally likely have equal probabilities. So this framework can be used with questions such as \"What is the probability of rolling a 4 on a six-sided die?\". Or, it could be used to calculate the probability of getting a sum of four on two rolls. \n",
    "\n",
    "This framework works with any situation where you can calculate a ratio of *possible outcomes* to *total equally likely outcomes*. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, this framework doesn't work when you don't have equally likely outcomes, such as for probability questions like \"What is the probability the universe will expand forever?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Frequentist\n",
    "This framework requires a hypothetical infinite sequence of trials and then we look at the relevant frequency in that sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, with the question \"What is the probability of rolling a 4 on a six-sided die?\" we can imagine roll a die over and over and count the ratio of times we get a 4. If we roll it a sufficiently large number of times we can approximate what it would be if we rolled it an infinite number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, there is an assumption that the probability we're trying to calculate is fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework works when we can experimentally do a large number of trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework doesn't work so well when trying to figure out one-off events such as \"What is the probability it will rain tomorrow?\". There is only one tomorrow, so it would be strange to think about an infinite sequence of tomorrows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, using this approach to get the probability that a die is fair doesn't work so well. The frequentist model requires us to assume the probability is fixed, so we say that the probability is either 0 (not fair) or 1 (fair). That is not particularly useful, because based on some evidence, we'd rather know something like \"there is an 82% probability it is fair\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bayesian\n",
    "The Bayesian approach embraces a synthesis of evidence and personal judgment regarding that evidence.\n"

    "## Experiments vs. Trials\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment_(probability_theory)):\n",
    "\n",
    "> In probability theory, an experiment or trial is any procedure that can be infinitely repeated and has a well-defined set of possible outcomes, known as the sample space. An experiment is said to be random if it has more than one possible outcome, and deterministic if it has only one. A random experiment that has exactly two (mutually exclusive) possible outcomes is known as a Bernoulli trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Random experiments are often conducted repeatedly, so that the collective results may be subjected to statistical analysis. A fixed number of repetitions of the same experiment can be thought of as a composed experiment, in which case the individual repetitions are called trials. For example, if one were to toss the same coin one hundred times and record each result, each toss would be considered a trial within the experiment composed of all hundred tosses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For something like a coin flip, or a roll of a die, we know the ratio of favorable to total outcomes, so we can easily calculate the ***Theoretical Probability*** without having to run an experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, if we we are trying to calculate something where we might not know the ratio of favorable to total outcomes, we might have to run an experiment and calculate an ***Experimental Probability***.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we may have an ad on Facebook, and we may be trying to calculate the probability of someone clicking on the ad. For each trial, someone will see the ad and either click or not click on it. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p( X ) = \\frac{ \\text { # successful trials } }{ \\text { # total trials } } $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Law of Large Numbers** tells us that as the total number of trials increases our experimental probability will approach our theoretical probability. For example, if we run a simulation of a fair coin toss experiment, after several hundred trials, our experimental probability will approach $.5$. This makes sense intuitively because as our total trials increases, each incremental new trial can have much less impact on changing the ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll discuss this further under the Expected Value section.\n",

    "## Sample Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of all possible outcomes for an event is also called the ***sample space***, so the number of possible outcomes is the size of the sample space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample space is often indicated with the symbol $\\Omega$ (capital omega).\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample space for a roll of a six-sided die is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Omega = \\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \\} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the probability of rolling a 4 on a six-sided die would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p( A ) = \\frac{1}{6} = 0.167 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because there is one favorable outcome (rolling a 4) and six possible outcomes (the number of elements in the sample space). \n",
    "\n",
    "A sample space can be compound, meaning that it can depend on multiple factors. For example the outcome of drawing a single card from a standard deck of cards can be considered compound because each card has a suit (e.g. heart or club) and a rank (e.g. 10, jack, queen).\n",

    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early days of HIV testing, an ELISA test was used to determine if someone tested positive for HIV by testing for antibodies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability that they tested positive given that they had HIV was:\n",
    "$$p( \\text{ + } | \\text{ HIV } ) = .977$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability that they tested negative given that they didn't have HIV was:\n",
    "$$p( \\text{ - } | \\text{ HIV' } ) = .926$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the test would give you an accurate result 90%+ of the time. This is often referred to as the *sensitivity* of the test. \n",
    "\n",
    "A study at during the same time showed that the probability of someone in North America having HIV was:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p( \\text{ HIV } ) = .0026 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "***Using this data as context, if we randomly select someone from North America, have them take the test, and they test positive for HIV, what's the probability that they actually have HIV?***\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p( \\text{ HIV } | \\text{ + } ) = \\text{?}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use Bayes Theorem to calculate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p( \\text{ HIV } | \\text{ + } ) = \\frac{ p( \\text{ + } | \\text{ HIV } ) \\cdot p( \\text{ HIV } ) }{ p( \\text{ + } | \\text{ HIV } ) \\cdot p( \\text{ HIV } ) + p( \\text{ + } | \\text{ HIV' } ) \\cdot p( \\text{ HIV' } )}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can derive:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p( \\text{ + } | \\text{ HIV' } ) = 1 - p( \\text{ - } | \\text{ HIV' } ) = 1 - .926 = .074 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p( \\text{ HIV' } ) = 1 - p( \\text{ HIV } ) = 1 - .0026 = .9974$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can calculate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p( \\text{ HIV } | \\text{ + } ) = \\frac{.977 \\cdot .0026}{ (.977 \\cdot .0026 ) + ( .074 \\cdot .9974 )} = .033$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if the randomly selected person tested positive, they only have a ***3.3% chance*** of actually having HIV!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is common with tests for rare diseases. The reason is because the rate of false positives (the part after the plus sign in the denominator) far outweighs the rate of true positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's say they take the test again. \n",
    "\n",
    "We could consider the joint distribution of the two separate tests, which are each conditional distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p( \\text{ + } | \\text{ HIV },  \\text{ + } | \\text{ HIV })$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the tests are independent, we can assume:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p( \\text{ + } | \\text{ HIV },  \\text{ + } | \\text{ HIV }) = p( \\text{ + } | \\text{ HIV } ) \\cdot p( \\text{ + } | \\text{ HIV } ) $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the notation, we'll define $++$ as getting a positive result on two separate tests. So the probability of having HIV, given that you tested positive twice is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p( \\text{ HIV } | \\text{ ++ } )$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And the probability of testing positive twice, given that you have HIV is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p( \\text{ ++ } | \\text{ HIV } )$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying Bayes Theorem to the two positive tests, we can calculate the probability of having HIV, given that two independent tests were both positive as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p( \\text{ HIV } | \\text{ ++ } ) = \\frac{ p( \\text{ ++ } | \\text{ HIV } ) \\cdot p( \\text{ HIV } ) }{ p( \\text{ ++ } | \\text{ HIV } ) \\cdot p( \\text{ HIV } ) + p( \\text{ ++ } | \\text{ HIV' } ) \\cdot p( \\text{ HIV' } )}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we assumed independence, we know:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p( \\text{ ++ } | \\text{ HIV } ) = p( \\text{ + } | \\text{ HIV } ) \\cdot p( \\text{ + } | \\text{ HIV } ) $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$$= .977 \\cdot .977 $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$$= .955$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And:\n",
    "\n",

    "$$= .074 \\cdot .074 $$ \n",
    "$$= .0055$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, with two positive tests, the probability increases:\n",

    "$$ p( \\text{ HIV } | \\text{ ++ } ) = \\frac{.955 \\cdot .0026}{ (.955 \\cdot .0026 ) + ( .0055 \\cdot .9974 )} = .3124$$\n",
